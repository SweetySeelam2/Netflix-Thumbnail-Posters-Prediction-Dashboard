# 🎬 Netflix Thumbnail Genre Prediction Dashboard

Deep Learning-Based CNN Classifier | Performance & Business Insights

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- This project explores how well a CNN-based deep learning model can classify Netflix poster thumbnails into genres like Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance, and Thriller.

- A dataset of 1,201 poster images was used, and predictions were visualized via a fully interactive Tableau dashboard.

- The project evaluates not just prediction accuracy but also genre-specific confusion, dominant patterns, and business value risks or opportunities.

- The goal is to help streaming platforms automate and optimize poster tagging workflows for better viewer targeting, reduced cost, and higher content discoverability.

---

## ❗ Business Challenge
- Global streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ often rely on manual tagging or rule-based systems to categorize content posters into genres.

- Misclassified or inconsistently tagged posters can mislead viewers, reduce click-through rates, and negatively affect content recommendations.

- There's a pressing need for automated, accurate, and explainable genre classification models that can scale across thousands of titles without manual intervention.

- Business stakeholders need clear, actionable insights into model behavior — not just raw predictions.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- A balanced dataset of 1,201 posters across 5 genres was created and used to train and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Results & Insights

- 📦 Total Posters Evaluated: 1,201

- 🎯 Overall Model Accuracy: 20.23% (243 posters correctly classified)

- ❌ Misclassification Rate: 79.77% (958 posters misclassified)

- 🔎 Accuracy by Genre:
    
    - ✅ Drama: 92.0% — the only genre with high classification accuracy

    - ⚠️ Thriller: 8.2%

    - ⚠️ Action: 2.7%

    - ❌ Romance: 0.5%

    - ❌ Comedy: 0.0% — model failed to classify any poster as Comedy

- 🔁 Top Confused Genres: Most posters from other genres were wrongly classified as Drama.

- 📌 Dominant Top-3 Prediction Pattern:
      
  - “Drama > Thriller > Romance” appeared 1,094 times, accounting for 91.1% of all predictions, showing a severe bias toward Drama.

## 💼 Business Impact

- Let’s assume Netflix uses this model to tag 100,000 poster thumbnails annually.

- 📌 Manual tagging cost/poster = $1.25

- 💸 Annual manual tagging cost = 100,000 × $1.25 = $125,000

**📉 Without the model:**
  
  - All posters would need manual labeling.

  - This leads to high operational costs and manual workload.

**📉 With the current model (Accuracy = 20.23%):**
  
  - Only 20,230 posters would be correctly classified.

  - ~79,770 posters (≈ 80%) would still require manual correction.

  - 💰 Estimated savings = 20,230 × $1.25 = $25,287

  - ❗ Uncovered cost (manual correction) = $99,713

**⚠️ Revenue Loss Due to Misclassification:**
  
  - Misleading thumbnails reduce CTR (Click-Through Rate) by 4–8%.

  - If a title earns $1,000,000/year, a 4% drop = $40,000 loss/title

  - Scaled to 1,000 titles/year, that’s $40M/year in opportunity loss

***🔥 Final Insight:***
  
  - Deploying the model as-is yields $25K in tagging savings but risks up to $40M in annual revenue loss.

  - Without improvement, this model would be counterproductive financially and should not be adopted in its current state.

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

If enhanced and adopted by streaming companies like:

  - Netflix

  - Amazon Prime Video

  - Disney+

  - HBO Max

  - Hulu

... the following strategies are essential:

**✅ Actionable Fixes**

- Retrain the model with:

    - More balanced and diverse samples — especially for Comedy, Romance, Action

    - Use more advanced deep learning architectures like EfficientNetV2 or Vision Transformers

- Augment inputs with metadata such as title, synopsis, release tags, etc.

- Use SHAP or LIME explainability to detect genre boundary confusion and biases

- Incorporate the model as a QA tool, not yet as a fully autonomous classifier

- Use Tableau insights to retrain only the most misclassified genre clusters iteratively

**📈 Business Potential**

Once model accuracy improves to 80%+, the platform can:

  - Save $100,000+ annually in manual tagging costs

  - Improve CTR and content match, leading to millions in additional revenue uplift

  - Reduce misclassification impact and increase viewer satisfaction and retention
